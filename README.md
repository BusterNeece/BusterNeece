Hello! I'm Buster Neece, a senior web application developer with a long background of building secure, modern, accessible web applications. The bulk of my experience is in the PHP language, though I'm increasingly transitioning into building frontend applications (primarily with VueJS) and configuring and using DevOps tools like Ansible and Docker.

## My Projects

Some of the things I'm working on right now:

 - The [AzuraCast](https://github.com/azuracast/azuracast) self-hosted web radio management suite (creator and lead developer)
 - AzuraCast's Icecast/SHOUTcast radio metadata library, [NowPlaying](https://github.com/azuracast/nowplaying) (maintainer)
 - AzuraCast's self-contained relay software, [AzuraRelay](https://github.com/azuracast/azurarelay) (maintainer)
 - [SupervisorPHP](https://github.com/supervisorphp/supervisor), a library for connecting PHP to the Supervisord process manager (maintainer)

## PHP-FIG

The AzuraCast project is a proud member project of (and I am the Project Representative for AzuraCast in) the [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/), or Framework Interoperability Group, a group advancing standards that build a common foundation upon which libraries can build that's easily understood and interoperable. You may recognize them from the PHP Standards Recommendations, or PSRs, they issue, like PSR-4 (autoloading), PSR-12 (code style), PSR-7 (HTTP request and response messages), and more. My own applications make heavy use of PSR-supporting libraries.

## Support Me

I spend a _lot_ of my time working on building open-source software and my flagship web application, so any support is always very greatly appreciated. You can find ways to support me via [AzuraCast's donations page](https://donate.azuracast.com/).
