Hello! I'm Buster Neece, a senior web application developer with an emphasis on secure, accessible PHP web applications.

I contribute to a number of open-source projects here on GitHub, but the majority of my work comes in the form of my web radio management suite, [AzuraCast](https://github.com/azuracast/azuracast).
